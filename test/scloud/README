In order to run the functional tests, you must first build and setup scloud.

Make sure you have a valid access token:

	$ scloud login

Make sure the tenant setting names the tenant that will be used for the tests.

	$ scloud set tenant <test-tenant>

Run the tests!

	$ python -m unittest discover .
