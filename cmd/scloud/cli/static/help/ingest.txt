Use Splunk Cloud CLI commands with the Ingest service to send event and metrics
data to a pipeline in Splunk Cloud.

The ingest command reads data from standard input (stdin) in the following formats:

    * raw:   The command interprets each line of input as a single line of raw 
             text event data.

    * json:  The command interprets each line of input as a single JSON object
             and posts it as structured JSON event data.

    * event: The command interprets each line of input as a JSON object that
             represents a fully formed event object, including body and event
             metadata.

    Use options to specify the host, source, and source type to assign to
    posted events.

    post-events [-host <host>] [-source <source>] [-sourcetype <sourcetype>] 
    [-format raw|json|event]
        Send one or more events to a pipeline. The command reads event data from
        stdin, and interprets each line as a separate event.

        Arguments:
            -host <host>
                The host name associated with the event.

            -source <source>
                The source of the event.

            -sourcetype <sourcetype>
                The source type of the event.

            -format raw|json|event
                The format of the event. The default is "raw".

    post-metrics [-host <host>] [-source <source>] [-sourcetype <sourcetype>] 
    [-dimensions <json-object>] [-type <metric-type>] [-unit <unit>]
        Post one or more metric events to a pipeline. The command reads metric 
        data from stdin, and interprets each line as a separate list of one or 
        more metrics.

        Arguments:
            -host <host>
                The host name associated with the event.

            -source <source>
                The source of the event.

            -sourcetype <sourcetype>
                The source type of the event.

            -dimensions <json-object>
                The default dimensions to use for all metrics posted by this
                command.

            -type <metric-type>
                The default metric type to use for all metrics posted by this
                command. The default is "g" for gauge.
