COMMANDS

* Authentication

    When you log in, scloud prompts you for credentials, then caches your access
    token and user name. Your access token expires after one hour. 

    Use the following commands to authenticate:  

        login
            Authenticate by providing your user name and password when prompted.

        get-context-cache
            Display your access token.

        delete-context-cache
            Delete your access token.


* Local settings and version

    For convenience, you can store values for a user name and tenant so that you
    don't have to provide these values for each new scloud session or command.
    Specify different values at the command line to override these settings.
